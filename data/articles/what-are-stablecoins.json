  "intro": "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, usually by being pegged to an asset like the US dollar. They matter because they allow people to move value quickly, avoid volatility, and access crypto platforms without constantly worrying about price swings. For beginners entering Web3, stablecoins are often the easiest on-ramp into the world of digital assets.",

      "heading": "How Do Stablecoins Work?",
      "content": "Stablecoins stay stable by being pegged to something more predictable—most commonly USD, but sometimes gold or other assets.\n\nThere are three main types:\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins – backed 1:1 by real money held in reserves. Most beginners start with fiat-backed stablecoins, such as USDC or USDT.\n\nCrypto-collateralized stablecoins – backed by digital assets like ETH, usually over-collateralized to absorb price swings (ex: DAI).\n\nAlgorithmic stablecoins – use supply-adjusting algorithms instead of backing (riskier and less common after historical failures).\n\nBecause of these models, stablecoins can keep a near-constant price of $1. This stability is what makes them so useful across exchanges, DeFi apps, and crypto gaming ecosystems."

      "heading": "Are Stablecoins Safe to Use?",
      "content": "Stablecoins can be safe, but their reliability depends on transparency, reserves, and regulation.\n\nHere's what to look for:\n\nAudited reserves – USDC publishes monthly attestation reports to verify its backing.\n\nReputation and trust – long-term track record matters.\n\nClear collateralization models – avoid projects lacking transparency.\n\nIt's important to understand the fundamentals behind each stablecoin's value.
