      "heading": "How Does Crypto Staking Work?",
      "content": "Staking allows crypto holders to \"lock\" their coins in a blockchain network. In return, participants earn rewards based on the amount staked and network rules. For example, staking Ethereum in a proof-of-stake (PoS) network helps validate transactions, and the network distributes rewards proportionally.\n\nA beginner might stake 100 ETH in a network with a 5% annual reward rate. Over a year, they could earn 5 ETH without selling their tokens. Many staking platforms also allow compounding rewards, which helps grow holdings faster over time. Some networks may have minimum staking requirements or lock-up periods, so beginners should read the terms carefully before committing funds."
